# Guess the Magic Number Game
The user will be asked if they'd like to guess the magic number. If the user enters 'Y' or 'y', a number will automatically be generated. Then the user will be asked to guess the number that the program has generated (Magic Number). The user will get hints depending if their guess is lower or higher than the Magic number. The game keeps track of the number of guesses it takes to guess the Magic Number, the total number of games the user plays, the avarage amount of tries it took to guess the Magic number, the largest amount of tries, and least amount of tries it has taken the user to guess correctly. After the user correctly guesses the Magic number, the game shows you the amount of tries it took, and user will get prompted if they'd liked to play again.
